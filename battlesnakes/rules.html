      <li>Each player arranges their ships on their own grid, which is a 10x10 square board. The ships cannot overlap or be placed diagonally. The standard fleet consists of five ships: aircraft carrier (5 squares), battleship (4 squares), cruiser (3 squares), submarine (3 squares), and destroyer (2 squares).</li>
      <li>Once the user has placed their ships, the game begins. Players take turns firing shots at their opponent's grid to locate and destroy their ships.</li>
      <li>You rotate firing one shot per turn. The objective is to accurately guess the coordinates of the opponent's ships and leave them with no ships left standing.</li>
      <li>When it's a user's turn, they tap a grid coordinate on the opponent's grid where they think an enemy ship is located.</li>
      <li>If the shot lands on a square occupied by an enemy ship, it's a "hit." The player marks the hit on their own "tracking" grid and gets another shot. If the shot misses, it's a "miss," and the player marks the miss on their tracking grid.</li>
      <li>Once all squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is "sunk." The player announces the sinking of a ship.</li>
      <li>The game continues until one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. That player is declared the winner.</li>
      <li>8. Make sure you check out the other games on Risky Battleships after the winner is decided!</li>
