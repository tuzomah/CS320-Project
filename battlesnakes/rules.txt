  1. Each player arranges their ships on their own 
grid, which is a 10x10 square board. The ships cannot
 overlap or be placed diagonally. The standard fleet 
consists of five ships: aircraft carrier (5 squares), 
battleship (4 squares), cruiser (3 squares), 
submarine (3 squares), and destroyer (2 squares).
  2. Once the user haw placed their ships, the game 
begins. Players take turns firing shots at their 
opponent's grid to locate and destroy their ships.
  3. You rotate firing one shot per turn. The objective
 is to accurately guess the coordinates of the opponent's 
ships and leave them with no ships left standing. 
  4. When it's a user's turn, they tap a grid coordinate 
on the opponent's grid where they think an enemy ship 
is located.
  5. If the shot lands on a square occupied by an enemy 
ship, it's a "hit." The player marks the hit on their 
own "tracking" grid and gets another shot. If the shot 
misses, it's a "miss," and the player marks the miss on 
their tracking grid.
  6. Once all squares of a ship have been hit, the 
ship is "sunk." The player announces the sinking of 
a ship.
  7. The game continues until one player has sunk 
all of the opponent's ships. That player is 
declared the winner.
