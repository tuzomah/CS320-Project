I used a mySQL database called 'rbs' with a table called 'Logins', so those are where all the column names in the mySQL querys in the users.js file come from.

make sure in the command prompt to enter: >npm install express
					  >npm install
					  >npm install ejs
					  >npm install mysql
					  >npm install express-session
					
In database.js use your mySQL username and password.  If you don't have a password, just remove that line from the code.


The 'views' folder is where the html (or in this case ejs) files that show the webpages are:
	Root page (localhost:3000/) will send the user to the login page
	login.ejs = Login page
	signup.ejs = Sign Up page
	resume.ejs (we'll replace this with Lauren's home page) = Home page
